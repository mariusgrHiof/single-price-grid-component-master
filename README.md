## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how to utilize flexbox to layout my page and make it responsive on tablet and mobile devices.

### Continued development

I'm going to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by continue creating more sites and adding javaScript to make the sites interactive.

### Useful resources
